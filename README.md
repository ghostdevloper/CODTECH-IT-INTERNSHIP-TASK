OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS

The code performs the following steps:

Imports necessary libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.

Loads the dataset: Assumes the dataset file 'Global_Superstore2[1].xlsx' is located in your working directory (refer to the path if different).
Displays the first 20 rows: Provides a glimpse of the data.

Calculates descriptive statistics: Summarizes central tendency (mean, median) and spread (standard deviation) using pandas and NumPy.

Provides basic information: Displays data types and non-null counts using pandas methods.

Handles missing values: Drops rows with missing postal codes (assuming 'Postal Code' is a relevant column).

Calculates descriptive statistics again: Verifies if missing values are handled as expected.

Creates histograms: Visualizes the distribution of numerical columns (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Shipping Cost).

Calculates and prints data range: Uses NumPy to find the range for each numerical column.

Creates scatter plots: Analyzes relationships between key variables (Sales vs Profit, Sales vs Discount, etc.).

Generates correlation heatmap: Creates a heatmap to visualize correlations between numeric columns.

Libraries Used
pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: for numerical computations.
matplotlib.pyplot: for creating visualizations (histograms, scatter plots).
seaborn: for advanced data visualization (heatmaps).
